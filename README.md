# TFTCanvas
TFTCanvas is a generic library that supports differents TFT Screens based on Adafruit_GFX.

This library is part of a educational course to learn C++ in practice in https://github.com/blascarr/TFTCourse or http://www.blascarr.com/ webpage.


This Library gives some helpful classes to manipulate Matrix Frames on a TFT Screen
With TFTCanvas we extend some dependency issues for use a variety of TFTScreens with Adafruit TFT library .
Nowadays is supported
